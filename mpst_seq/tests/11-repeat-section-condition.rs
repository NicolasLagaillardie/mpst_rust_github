// So far our macro has repeated the entire loop body. This is not sufficient
// for some use cases because there are restrictions on the syntactic position
// that macro invocations can appear in. For example the Rust grammar would not
// allow a caller to write:
//
//     enum Interrupt {
//         seq!(N in 0..16 {
//             Irq#N,
//         });
//     }
//
// because this is just not a legal place to put a macro call.
//
// Instead we will implement a way for the caller to designate a specific part
// of the macro input to be repeated, so that anything outside that part does
// not get repeated. The repeated part will be written surrounded by #(...)*.
//
// The invocation below should expand to:
//
//     #[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Debug)]
//     enum Interrupt {
//         Irq0,
//         ...
//         Irq15,
//     }
//
// Optionally, allow for there to be multiple separate #(...)* sections,
// although the test suite does not exercise this case. The #(...)* sections
// will each need to be repeated according to the same loop bounds.
