// Suppose we wanted a seq invocation in which the upper bound is given by the
// value of a const. Both macros and consts are compile-time things so this
// seems like it should be easy.
//
//     static PROCS: [Proc; NPROC] = seq!(N in 0..NPROC { ... });
//
// In fact it isn't, because macro expansion in Rust happens entirely before
// name resolution. That is, a macro might know that something is called NPROC
// but has no way to know which of many NPROC values in the dependency graph
// this identifier refers to. Or maybe the NPROC constant doesn't exist yet when
// the macro runs because it is only emitted by a later macro that hasn't run
// yet. In this compilation model it isn't possible to support a query API where
// a macro can give it the name of a constant and receive back the value of the
// constant.
//
// All hope is not lost; it just means that our source of truth for the value of
// NPROC must be a macro rather than a constant. The code in this test case
// implements this workaround.
//
// This test case may or may not require code changes in your seq macro
// implementation depending on how you have implemented it so far. Before
// jumping into any code changes, make sure you understand what the code in this
// test case is trying to do.
