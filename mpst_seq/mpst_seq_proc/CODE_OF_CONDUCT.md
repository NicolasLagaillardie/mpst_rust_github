# Code of conduct

All projects under *https:<!--disable autolink-->//github.com/NicolasLagaillardie* adopt the
**[Rust Code of Conduct]**. Everyone is held to the same standard of conduct
when interacting in these repositories as if they were rust-lang repositories.

[Rust Code of Conduct]: https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct

## Enforcement

Please contact David Tolnay at *lagaillardie.nicolas<!--disable autolink-->@live.fr* to
call attention to code of conduct violations.

Note that while we elect to follow the Rust Code of Conduct, this is not an
official Rust venue, and consequently enforcement of the code of conduct in
these repositories is not the responsibility of the Rust moderation team.
