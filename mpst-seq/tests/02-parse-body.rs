// The macro invocation in the previous test case contained an empty loop body
// inside the braces. In reality we want for the macro to accept arbitrary
// tokens inside the braces.
//
// The caller should be free to write whatever they want inside the braces. The
// seq macro won't care whether they write a statement, or a function, or a
// struct, or whatever else. So we will work with the loop body as a TokenStream
// rather than as a syntax tree.
//
// Before moving on, ensure that your implementation knows what has been written
// inside the curly braces as a value of type TokenStream.
