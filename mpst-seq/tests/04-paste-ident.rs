// One of the big things callers will want to do with the sequential indices N
// is use them as part of an identifier, like f0 f1 f2 etc.
//
// Implement some logic to paste together any Ident followed by `#` followed by
// our loop variable into a single concatenated identifier.
//
// The invocation below will expand to:
//
//     fn f1() -> u64 { 1 * 2 }
//     fn f2() -> u64 { 2 * 2 }
//     fn f3() -> u64 { 3 * 2 }
//
// Optionally, also support more flexible arrangements like `f#N#_suffix` ->
// f0_suffix f1_suffix etc, though the test suite only requires `prefix#N` so
// you will need to add your own tests for this feature.
//

// This f0 is written separately to detect whether your macro correctly starts
// with the first iteration at N=1 as specified in the invocation. If the macro
// incorrectly started at N=0 like in the previous tests cases, the first
// generated function would conflict with this one and the program would not
// compile.
